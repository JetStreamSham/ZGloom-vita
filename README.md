# ZGloom-Vita

A port of [ZGloom](https://github.com/Swizpig/ZGloom) for the PlayStation Vita.<br>
A fork of [ZGloom-vita](https://github.com/JetStreamSham/ZGloom-vita) from [JetStreamSham](https://github.com/JetStreamSham)

## What is Gloom?

[Gloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloom_(video_game)) was a 1995 Doom-clone from Black Magic Software for Commodore Amiga. It had [very messy and meaty graphics](https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1781) and needed a very powerful Amiga computer back then (A1200 @ 030 was far too low). It had several official successors like Gloom Deluxe/Ultimate Gloom (a graphical enhanced Gloom), Gloom 3, Zombie Massacre and even some full-game conversion of 90's Amiga games.

# Instructions

## How to play

Gloom was made freely available by its developers [here](https://github.com/earok/GloomAmiga/archive/master.zip).<br>
To play on PS VITA download the .zip, extract it somewhere to your harddrive and copy only the folders to the following location on vita:
> ux0:/data/zgloom/ 

For the other official games using the Black Magic "Gloom"-engine like [Gloom 3](http://aminet.net/package/game/shoot/UltimateGloomISO) and [Zombie Massacre](http://aminet.net/package/game/shoot/ZombieMassacreISO) you can load them for free on Aminet. At the moment only the `ux0:/data/zgloom` directory can be used, so if you have more than only "Gloom" be sure make separate directories like _ZGLoom3_ or _ZombieMassacre_ and rename them before playing.

## In-game music

ZGloom can now add in-game music using any module that XMP can play. Put the mods in the sfxs folder and add "song_blitz.mod" or whatever the module name is to the script. Multiple song_ commands are allowed, allowing per-level music.

## Building on Linux

1. Install the [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/).
2. Install the LibXMP vita library [port](https://github.com/JetStreamSham/libxmp). See the [porting libraries](https://vitasdk.org/) section for installtion instructions.
3. Generate makefile with `cmake CMakeLists.txt`.
4. Compile with `make`.

# TODO
Change renderer
Perhaps a launcher for all Gloom versons

# License

Dunno. [The Gloom source release](https://github.com/earok/GloomAmiga) says only the .s and .bb2 files are open source, but the Gloom executable bakes in some maths lookup tables (but then, they are generated by the .bb2 files), bullet and sparks graphics, and 
the title screen for Classic Gloom. I probably won't add the latter and just display the Black Magic image, or something.
